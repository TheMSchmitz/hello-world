Just a test repository

This is being created as a test, and at the date of this creation (05/29/2020) the Nation is in the midst of:
- a pandemic :nauseated_face: killing :coffin: thousands and changing everyones lives :mask:, 
- the economy :dollar: is teetering on the brink because of shutdowns to deal with the pandemic, 
- people are being asked to stay in their homes :house: and restricted from social contact with others, 
- and the cities :cityscape: of Minneapolis and Saint Paul are being destroyed by rioters, aronsists :fire: and looters as the result of the police :policeman: killing of George Floyd

Strange days indeed! :cold_sweat:
Most peculiar Mama.
